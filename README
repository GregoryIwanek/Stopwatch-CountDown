STOPWATCH_COUNTDOWN QML

SIMPLE STOPWATCH_COUNTDOWN WITH QTQUICK/QML

Goals:
QML SECTION
-custom button ✓
-custom text ✓
-custom scrollbar ✓
-loading sections by Loader component to a ListView ✓
-stopwatch section layout ( ListView for printing results, buttons, text)✓
-countdown stack section ( create map to navigate to subsections)✓
-countdown set time subsection layout ( based on vertical PathView) ✓
-countdown main section ( ListView for printing results, buttons, text)✓
-code section for stopwatch section ✓
-code section for countdown section ✓

C++ SECTION
-create class for storing splitted string with results (DataObject)✓
-create class for handling methods between QML/C++ and loading stored results from .txt file ( DataMethods), and saving them there✓
-expand data model ( read from .txt file) from c++ to QML by using rootContext ✓
-connect save/load functions from DataMethods with QML by using Q_INVOCABLE, Q_PROPERTY macros ✓
-connect model to ListView delegates in correct sections ✓
-create class for storing global settings ✓ ( FOR FUTURE USE)

ISSUES
-performance upon scrolling ListView ✓ ( do not use "rotation" in ListView and ListView's delegates)
-fix freezed Timer while app is sleeping/background ✓ ( Date().getTime() instead of Timer intervals)
-fix starting from ending point between sessions ✓ ( Settings component in Code sections for storing current state)
-connect model from C++ to QML ✓ ( expanding properties with rootContext and Q_PROPERTY(QQmlListProperty<QObject>)
-connect methods from C++ to QML ✓ ( expanding with Q_INVOCABLE and Q_QMLPROPERTY)
-location of .txt file of executable version ✓ ( just put in main executable folder)
-set fixed orientation ( portrait/vertical)✓ ( edit manually AppManifest file with extra lines)
-clear comments ✓

ISSUES TO DO
-fix conflict between variables for two instances of CodeSection between sessions - ( workaround- sadly, two different files with
same code, but with different first letters of variables-> there is a conflict between variables from StopWatch and CountDown saved
in Settings-> they can overwrite themselfs upon new session, even while id of Sections ( CountDown and StopWatch)
and Settings ( setting for StopWatch and CountDown) are different)
